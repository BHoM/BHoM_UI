# Core BHoM_UI Repo

This repo is part of the Buildings and Habitats object Model. 
If you are new (_welcome!_  üëã üòÑ)  a great place to start is on [bhom.xyz](https://bhom.xyz) and reading our [documentation](https://bhom.xyz/documentation), including our [Getting Started Pages](https://bhom.xyz/documentation/Basics/Using-the-BHoM/).

This particular repo contains the parent _BHoM UI_ defining all the base functionality necessary to expose the BHoM functionality through user interfaces.

The BHoM UI provides a central definition of the way the BHoM is exposed to the user. This includes the list of available components (icons, names,...), the way they are saved/loaded, as well as the various menus to create/interact with them. This guarantees that the learning curve of using the BHoM from one software to another is as minimal as possible. See [BH.UI ‚Äê Expose Your Code to UIs](https://github.com/BHoM/documentation/wiki/BH.UI-%E2%80%90-Expose-Your-Code-to-UIs) for more details.


Along with the rest of the core repositories - [BHoM](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM), [BHoM_Engine](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM_Engine) and [BHoM_Adapter](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM_Adapter) ‚Äì this is the basis on which all of the BHoM Toolkits are built.

## Quick Start üöÄ 

Grab the [latest installer](https://bhom.xyz/) and a selection of [sample scripts](https://github.com/BHoM/samples).


## Getting Started for Developers ü§ñ 

If you want to build the BHoM and the Toolkits from source, it's hopefully easy! üòÑ 
Do take a look at our specific wiki pages here: [Getting Started for Developers](https://bhom.xyz/documentation/Guides-and-Tutorials/Coding-with-BHoM/).
